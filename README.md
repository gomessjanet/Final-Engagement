# Final Engagement
## Offensive Attack & Analysis of a Vulnerable Network

### The objective was to practice different concepts (learned throughout the Cybersecurity Bootcamp) as a Pentester and SOC Analyst.
- Find vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and exploits to gain access to a vulnerable Wordpress server (Target 1).
- Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher (Kibana).
- User Wireshark to analyze and find malicious activity on the network traffic.

Note: 
This presentation was created as a group. We were assigned to present our findings as a team. We chose to cover:
- Network Topology
- Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses
- Analyze Alarms & Thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher (Kibana)
- Implement Hardening Methods
The Offensive, Defensive and Network Analysis reports are my own work.
