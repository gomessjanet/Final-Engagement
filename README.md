# Final Engagement
## Offensive Attack & Analysis of a Vulnerable Network

### The objective was to practice different concepts (learned throughout the Cybersecurity Bootcamp) as a Pentester and SOC Analyst.

#### The following reports highlight the work, process and findings that contributed to the Final Presentation:
- [Defensive Security](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c83OfNB_DthYOepmK7ml0tnl5LnK3k3j/view?usp=sharing) - Assess a vulnerable VM (vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and exploits) to gain access to a vulnerable Wordpress server (Target 1) and verify that the Kibana rules work as expected.
- [Offensive Security](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8Dcd36bkhewNZ0t3riXiPSLceAUII-A/view?usp=sharing) - Implements alerts and thresholds, in Elasticsearch Watcher (Kibana), we determined would be effective.
- [Network Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJzVRSL6NR7BJ9OKKoRWnFrwTQJvgN25/view?usp=sharing) - Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious activity on the network traffic.

Note: 
This presentation was created as a group. We were assigned to present our findings as a team. We chose to cover:
- Network Topology
- Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses
- Analyze Alarms & Thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher (Kibana)
- Implement Hardening Methods
The Offensive, Defensive and Network Analysis reports are my own work.
